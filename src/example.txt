1. Initialize the Simulator
    a. Define Constants
        - MOTOR_TORQUE = 2 NM
        - MOTOR_SPEED = 20 radians/second
        - GRAVITY = 9.8 m/s^2
    b. Define Simulator Parameters
        - Starting Angle
        - Motor Torque
        - Ball Release Angle
        - Ball Weight

2. Define Functions
    a. calculateLaunchDistance(startingAngle, motorTorque, ballReleaseAngle)
        - Calculate launch distance based on input parameters
        - Use physics equations to model ball trajectory
        - Return launch distance


REMEMBER: 
- These are only for guidance, you are free to be creative, create new structures, variables, functions and a GUI to your liking.
- Please provide some way to interact with your simulator.
