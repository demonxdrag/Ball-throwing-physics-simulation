This project uses `NPM` package manager to install dependencies, it is needed for both installing and running the project.

## Setup
_Before we begin_ we need to locate ourselves inside the __react-implementation__ folder.

To install the dependencies run
```
npm install
```

## Configuration
There is a configuration file inside `./src/config/config.ts` containing a set of variables that can be tweaked _before_ starting the application. They follow the specification by default.

## Running the simulator
To start the service execute
```
npm start
```

A webpage will open, if not you can access this UI from `http://localhost:3000/`
